        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">My Background</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          In <strong>May 2025</strong>, I graduated from <strong>Auburn University</strong> with a degree in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>.
          For as long as I can remember, my plan was to become an engineer. In eighth grade, I was accepted into an
          <strong>engineering magnet program</strong> for high school, where I thrived and graduated near the top of my class.
          My time at Auburn flew by. I gained a <strong>wide range of engineering fundamentals</strong>, and now I’m eager to
          <strong>apply those skills</strong> in a professional setting—while continuing to grow and learn.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What I Love About Engineering</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          All the typical buzzwords associated with engineering have always resonated with me:
          <span class="font-semibold">Math. Science. Technology. Puzzles. Problem Solving.</span>
          But it wasn’t until I got to Auburn that I realized <strong>engineering is so much more</strong>.
          Every product we interact with—from alarm clocks to zip-lock bags—has been
          <strong>designed to perform perfectly</strong>. That’s what I love most:
          <strong>engineering is everywhere</strong>, and I’m confident there’s a place where I can help
          <strong>create something great</strong>.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Beyond Engineering</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Some of my most meaningful accomplishments have taken place <strong>outside the classroom</strong>.
          I’ve played the <strong>trumpet for over 12 years</strong>, including four years in the
          <strong>Auburn University Marching Band</strong> and <strong>Basketball Pep Band</strong>.
          Our director often said that the <strong>soft skills</strong> learned in AUMB—teamwork, time management,
          high standards, and leadership—will carry us forward in any career.
          <br /><br />
          I am also an <strong>Eagle Scout</strong>, a distinction earned through <strong>years of service,
          leadership, and perseverance</strong>. For my Eagle project, I <strong>designed and built a trail</strong>
          through <strong>Fort Mitchell National Cemetery</strong> in Alabama—an experience that taught me as much about
          <strong>project execution</strong> as it did about <strong>community impact</strong>.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What’s Next</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Pursuing a degree in engineering has always been my plan, and I’m proud to have achieved it.
          I chose <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> because it provides a <strong>broad foundation</strong>
          that opens the door to many fields.
          <br /><br />
          As for what’s next, I’m excited to find a position that will allow me to <strong>keep learning</strong>,
          while contributing <strong>meaningful solutions</strong> through the knowledge I already have.
